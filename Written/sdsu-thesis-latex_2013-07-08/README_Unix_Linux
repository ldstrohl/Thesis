SDSU Mathematics LaTeX Thesis Template
--------------------------------------
UNIX/Linux Instructions
----------------------
The file thesis.tex has to be compiled (processed) to produce a
postscript or pdf file that will be nicely typeset.  You may do this
from the command line, or using the makefile included with this
distribution.  In either case, you need to have the file
sdsu-thesis.cls in the current directory where you are working or
installed where the other LaTeX classes are. 

Command line:

To make a postcript document you will need to run the commands as follows
(you must run latex several times to get all references and tables of
contents right).  

 latex thesis
 bibtex thesis
 latex thesis
 latex thesis

Now you will have a thesis.dvi and must convert that to a postcript file.
This is done with the dvips command as follows:

 dvips -o thesis.ps thesis

(If you have your computer set up for different paper sizes, you might
 have to add `-t letter' option to the dvips command line.  This for example
 happens if your computer is set up for some other language then
 American English.)

To get a PDF file you can then convert your thesis.ps file as follows

 ps2pdf thesis.ps thesis.pdf

There is also a directory in this distribution which contains a longer
example which has been adapted from the original SDSU Thesis template.
This is in the directory 'long-example'.

Using the Makefile:

On Linux or UNIX, the supplied `Makefile' should do all the above for you,
so if you just run ``make'' in this directory you will get a thesis.ps
produced.  You can also run ``make view'' which will automatically run 
gv (ghostview) for you.  So you could open a text editor and whenever
you make a change and want to see how it looks, you could just run
``make view''.  The conversion to pdf is also quite simple, you can just
run ``make thesis.pdf'' and that will produce a postscript file and then
convert it to PDF format for you.

Printing:

On UNIX or Linux you can type ``lpr thesis.ps'' to print your thesis
(on rohan the command is different depending on the printer).  You
can also print from the Postscript viewer.

Installing the class file:

To install the class file (the sdsu-thesis.cls file) on a Linux or UNIX
system, you can either place it in a directory ~/texmf/tex/latex/ (where ~
refers to your home directory) or wherever LaTeX is installed on the system
(on my system for example it is at /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/).  If you
install the class file you will no longer need to have it in the current
directory where you run the command ``latex''.  However it is not needed to
install the class file unless you are using some tools other then just a text
editor to write the document and those tools require the class file to be
installed.  After you install the class file in the correct location you must
run the ``texhash'' program, otherwise LaTeX will not see it.  If you are
using the supplied Makefile, ``make install'' will automatically install the
class file in your home directory.

Note that you can always arrow up to the last command and press enter to
re-run it on most unix shells, so that you don't have to retype things all
the time at the command line.

Graphical Editors:

There exist several graphical editors for LaTeX.  The one I found that
works nice is Kile http://kile.sourceforge.net/ which runs
under Linux (there are packages for SuSE and Red Hat at the
above site).  With this program you just open the thesis.tex file and edit.
It will give you some help with LaTeX commands but it's really a text editor.
When you make a change you can just press F1 and it will rebuild the
postscript file and show you the output.

Another such tool that should work with Linux, Windows and MacOS is
Texmaker, http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index.html, but I have not
tried this tool.  It seem it is only distributed as source code and must be
recompiled for your system.

There is also a host of emacs packages that help with latex writing, some of
them even giving graphical preview of what you are typing, but emacs is not the
easiest text editor out there.

There are some other latex editors I found on the net, some of which work
under Windows and Mac OS in addition to Linux, but I have not been able
to make this thesis work with them as more configuration was needed and
I'm not really familiar with any of them.  These are Lyx (http://www.lyx.org)
and TeXmacs (http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~anh/TeXmacs/TeXmacs.html).  If you
make things work with these editors you should contribute some documentation
about how to use them with the SDSU thesis class.
