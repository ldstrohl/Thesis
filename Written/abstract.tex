This is my abstract which describes my thesis. It isn't done yet; this is a placeholder.

Many extraterrestrial missions require a powered descent phase. Because this phase is late in the mission its fuel efficiency has an outsized effect on payload capacity. This thesis presents a strategy for optimizing fuel use using well tested guidance algorithms and a unique strategy that reduces fuel consumption over conventional strategies by a significant margin and has wide applicability.
